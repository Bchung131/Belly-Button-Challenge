# Belly-Button-Challenge
In this assignment, consist of building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, the rest relatively rare.
